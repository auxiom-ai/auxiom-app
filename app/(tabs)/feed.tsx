      "US-China trade war escalates! Tariffs on Chinese low-value imports jump from 34% to 84%, effective April 9, 2025, in response to China's retaliation.",
    time: "36M AGO",
    articleCount: 5,
    fullStory:
      "The escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have reached a new peak with the implementation of significantly higher tariffs on Chinese imports. This move represents a 50 percentage point increase from the previous 34% rate, affecting a wide range of low-value consumer goods. The decision comes as a direct response to China's retaliatory measures implemented earlier this year. Economic analysts predict this will lead to higher consumer prices across multiple sectors, increased business operational costs, and potential supply chain disruptions. The tit-for-tat nature of these trade policies suggests further escalation may be on the horizon, with both nations showing little sign of backing down from their respective positions.",

      "In a closely watched decision, the Federal Reserve has announced a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate, bringing it to its lowest level since early 2023. This marks the third consecutive rate cut this year as the central bank attempts to stimulate economic growth amid concerns about slowing inflation and employment rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited global economic uncertainties and domestic market volatility as key factors in the decision. The move is expected to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially boosting spending and investment. However, critics argue that the aggressive monetary policy could lead to asset bubbles and increased financial risk-taking.",

The new standards require a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2027, with interim targets beginning in 2026. Industries affected include steel production, chemical manufacturing, and automotive assembly. Companies that fail to meet the new standards face substantial penalties, including potential facility shutdowns. Environmental groups have praised the move as essential for meeting climate goals, while industry representatives warn of potential job losses and increased production costs that could be passed on to consumers.",
